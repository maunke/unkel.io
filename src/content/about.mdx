<h1>About</h1>

<!-- toc -->

Hello, I am Markus, 32 years old and live in Hamburg with my wife Sophia and our
cretan hound Friedel.

I enjoy solving and preventing technical problems using software, computational
and data science; mainly in Rust and Python.

In Bonn I studied physics since it's an amazing discipline that tries to
understand and describe the nature with a mixture of maths, human assumptions,
analogies and experiments.

Realizing that also in physics over the last decades more and more solutions are
supported by computational and data science, I studied in that field in Jena.

In 2015 I founded <a href="//colorfit.ai">ColorFit</a> to solve a printing
industry problem of having a trial & error process before finally printing inks
on substrate against all target colors. The solution is written down in a patent
(granted in USA, ISR, IND; pending in EU and CN).

After collecting all these tools I wanted to learn about how the German
Mittelstand is solving problems in the triangle between physics, computational
and data science by working in a small Data Lab in Dortmund. I have learned one
very important thing: Before driving real innovation (creating valuable IP) in a
company from outside you need to know more about the inside.

That's why I started to work as a tech lead in a german packaging venture. With
a mixture of brave and vision I build a prepress automation full-stack software
from scratch. Customers are now getting prepress checks on their artworks and a
realistic 3D model within seconds. That software is also the fundament that
decouples completely the venture and every digital printing converter regarding
all prepress requirements around artworks. All that saves a lot of money and
time. More important, I had the pleasure to lead a tech team of talented
developers incl. building up a tech culture.

As software engineer and data scientist I am working as a freelancer by
supporting companies to build, extend and scale their products.

Best regards
