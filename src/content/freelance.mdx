<h1>MU:T</h1>

<!-- toc -->

Under markusunkel.tech (MU:T), I work as a freelance software engineer,
computational and data scientist based in Hamburg, Germany, with my office in
the new [Deutschlandhaus](//deutschlandhaus.com/en).

MU:T means bravery in German and controlled change in Rust, and describes my way
of working: challenging assumptions, experimenting safely outside your project,
and making deliberate decisions that move it in the right direction.

I solve and prevent technical problems by writing concepts, designing
architectures, and implementing solutions primarily in Rust and Python. With a
background in [physics, computational and data science](/about#education), I
have spent my [career](/about#professional-experience) turning complex,
theory-heavy domains into reliable, scalable software systems. This includes
founding a company with [patented technology](/about#patents) in the printing
industry, building automation and data-driven products from scratch, and leading
engineering teams.

## Clients

I work on business-critical systems and intellectual property for my clients.
For this reason, detailed project descriptions remain confidential.

Instead, I focus on generalized system patterns, problem classes, and
architectural concepts drawn from client projects, which you can find further
down in the section
[anonymized system concepts by client projects](#anonymized-system-concepts-by-client-projects).

## What You Can Expect

- Clear, direct communication.
- Outcome-driven thinking: strategy first, execution second.
- Sustainable solutions designed for handover and long-term ownership; no
  single-point dependency.
- Radical honesty about fit, yours and mine.

## Engineering Stack & Expertise

This section highlights technologies I have used extensively in production
systems. These are areas where I bring hands-on experience, architectural
judgment, and long-term ownership; not just familiarity.

## Anonymized System Concepts by Client Projects

- [Full-Stack Growth Architecture](#full-stack-growth-architecture)

### Priority-Based Rate Limiting Service

**Challenge**

The rate of notifications sent out via a customer engagement platform (CEP) to
my clients customers needs to be limited. By introducing a rate limit, messages
get a priority label that is required when the rate cap takes effect.
Furthermore there is an API rate limit on CEP's side that should be handled
gracefully. The sum of all notifications $x$ sent out within a time range
$\Delta t$ should be smaller than the rate limit $R$ for any given point in time
$t$:

$$
\sum_{x \in X} \left[t - \Delta t \lt t^{out}_x \le t\right] = N(t) \le R
$$

We notice the time of receiving the intention that a notification $x$ should be
sent out with $t^{in}_x$. The priorization of a notification is noticed by $p_x$
such that we need to guarantee, that

$$
p_x < p_y \wedge t^{in}_x = t^{in}_y\Rightarrow t^{out}_x < t^{out}_y +
\epsilon
$$

such that prio 1 notifications are priotized in favor of prio 2 notifications
within a tolerance of $\epsilon$. Furthemore we want to weakly guarantee that we
are following the FIFO principal for notifications with the same prio $p$, such
that

$$
p_x = p_y \wedge t^{in}_x < t^{in}_y \Rightarrow t^{out}_x < t^{out}_y +
\epsilon
$$

holds.

**Solution Design**

Messages are queued by priority. Each prio queue has a scalable consumer group
of workers that are all sharing its reservation volume information in a
Key-Value DB. This means that a worker with prio $p$ with a reserved volume
$V_p$ (valid for a specified TTL) is allowed to process $V_p$ messages. If the
sum of reserved volumes exceeds the global rate limit volume, the requesting
worker with prio $p$ sets the rate-limit-hitted:p with a specified rate-limit
hitted TTL, such that all requesting workers with priority $r > p$ cannot
reserve a message volume until the restriction is resolved.

Furthermore deduplication is ensured by using message hashes as deduplication
keys with a specified deduplication TTL in the key-value database.

Unprocessable (not accepted by CEP) messages are moved to a dead letter queue.

>
  <CaseCEPDiagram />
</DiagramFigure>

**Result**

The implementation handled successfully the targeted api input pressure of 2
Mio. mgs/s with a median latency of ~50ms and processed highest prio messages
with a median latency of ~250ms (incl. latency of calling CEP) between $t^{in}$
and $t^{out}$.

### Full-Stack Growth Architecture

**Challenge**

An architecture needs to be designed for an early-stage product expected to
evolve rapidly based on its first key accounts, while the teams scaled in
parallel.

Planned and required components:

- Mobile and web applications
- Services: E-Commerce, CMS, Core, Authentication, Notifications
- Data-driven real-time decisions based on customer activities
- Key account specific services
- CRM and CEP (customer engagement platform)
- API for 3rd Party Services

The stack should be sustainable in terms of investment and technical debts.

**Solution Design**

Before diving into the solution; in my experience, there are two general options
to solve these broad challenge strategically:

1. Planning a relaunch budget from the beginning on in order to fully focus on
   the first features (not on architecture) for the first key accounts by
   risking the rise of technical debts and a substantial day-2 operations
   overhead which will cause a relaunch which in turn can jeopardize the
   business model and cash flow later.
1. Invest upfront into an architecture that strategically allows to grow in
   terms of complexity, team sizes and changing business requirements which in
   turn allows the company to specifically hire new employees by having the
   architecture evolvement in mind.

The client has chosen the second option by relying on the following strategical
and technical elements implied by the architecture drawn below in figure 4.

- **Single source of truth (SSOT) / One Contract**: When having changing
  business requirements, the most important part is the information
  architecture, meaning the business graph model that is reflected in the
  federated api schema and in the process workflows on service layer / messaging
  system. This allows to have a contract between the different teams to work and
  plan on, e.g. the marketing automation team knows which events can be used to
  build journeys on or a key account manager can discuss with the tech leads the
  implications of new features in a dialogue (no one-way communication).

- **MVP**: The MVP was designed to validate the business model while already
  establishing the architectural backbone required for growth:
  1. Establish the core information architecture by implementing the most
     critical services on the service layer.
  1. Expose a stable contract via a federated API to enable early mobile and web
     applications.
  1. Introduce event tracking and messaging to support initial KPIs, customer
     journeys, and the customer data pipeline that ingests raw customer data
     into the data warehouse and CEP / CRM.

- **Growth**: The growth phase extended the same architectural principles to
  support more teams, higher traffic and key-account-specific requirements;
  without restructuring the core system:
  1. Scale team onboarding by using the SSOT and One Contract as a shared
     planning and implementation reference.
  1. Expand analytics and activation capabilities by introducing ETL and Reverse
     ETL components as requirements by sales, marketing, business and UX teams
     matured.
  1. Grow horizontally with new key account specific features and services
     without leaving the architecture.

**Result**

As business requirements shifted significantly in the first year, the
architecture absorbed change without major rework. Services were added and
deprecated without destabilizing the platform, allowing engineers to stay
focused on product delivery instead of repeated architectural resets.
