# Welcome

[I am Markus](/about) a software engineer, inventor, computational and data
scientist. This is where I write down and share my thoughts, projects and
experiences.

Your time is valuable, every single word is written by myself to provide
original, non-inflated content.

Please do not hesitate to [contact me](/#personal-information) with any
feedback, questions or suggestions.

## Plans for Q1'26

- Researching a new Optimal Design Feature Selection (ODFS) algorithm that
  integrates SFFS with D-, C-, and cost-optimality, allowing feature selection
  and measurement design to be performed in an alternating framework. **[in
  progress]**
- Migrate infra within Hetzner from single server to k8s cluster and software
  delivery platform from CaptainRover to KubeVela. **[in progress]**
- Start building an open-source best-practice full-stack project for a
  maintainable, safe, flexible and scalable web application:
  - Frontend: Sveltekit + Houdini GraphQL
  - Federated API: Apollo Router (graphql, apollo federation, relay)
  - Backend: Rust + Seaorm (codegen from pg schema) + juniper
  - DB: Postgres (sequin for cdc as default dual-write problem solution) + maybe
    pg extension for authz and business logic with pgrx
  - Zero downtime migration via pgroll
  - Events: Nats Jetstream
  - Durable execution: restate
- Revisit reinforcement learning algorithms and implement them in Rust (burn).
- Reboot [quantum-simulation.de](//quantum-simulation.de) project by migrating
  the heavy computation part from javascript to WASM in Rust (maybe leptos
  full-stack framework + bevy for rendering) and improve the UX.
